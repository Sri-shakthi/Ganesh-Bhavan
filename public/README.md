# Public Assets Folder

Place your static assets here (images, videos, etc.).

## Success Video

Place your `Success.webm` file in this folder. The file should be named exactly:
- `Success.webm`

The form will automatically reference it at `/Success.webm`.

## How to add the video:

1. Copy your `Success.webm` file
2. Paste it directly into this `public` folder
3. Make sure it's named `Success.webm` (case-sensitive)
4. The form will automatically use it!
